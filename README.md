In this exercise, you will have to build a React component that allows the user to select one or many values in a list/tree.
The user should be able to see which items they have selected. It is up to you to figure out how to do that.
You will start with a boilerplate app and a JSON file containing mock data. (In practice, that JSON would be fetched from an API.)
The data is a list of items with children and is provided in src/data.json.
You could imagine this component being used in a form where a user needs to select which items they are going to buy.
The challenge should take anything from 2 to 4 hours. It's ok to turn it in unfinished if you don't want to spend more than the recommended time, we don't want the process to be too long.


Requirements:

The user should be able to select 1 or many items in the list.
The user should be able to see what items they have selected.
The user should be able to search for items by typing an input to filter the list.
Have some kind of display to show the underlying data of the user's selection.


Bonus:

Simulate an api call to the mock data.


Things to note:

Cross-browser compatibility is not a requirement. You can specify which browser we should view the work in.
Please avoid using external libraries that solve any of the requirements above (feel free to use redux, css frameworks, an http library, or any other modules that will help take care of boilerplate code).
Make sure to add some tests, it's important to know that the code works.
Don't hesitate to comment your code where you deem necessary.
This project is setup using create-react-app (CRA_README) and TypeScript. If you prefer to use something else feel free to do so. Just make sure it is JavaScript based and easy for us to run.

Let us know how we should run the app.


If you use JS instead of TS, please add some PropTypes.
